## Greenbook iOS App

### Introduction
The Greenbook iOS app is an intelligent application designed to assist home plant owners in growing their plants better. It incorporates machine learning models to classify and recognize plants, identify diseased or unhealthy parts, and provide recommendations for plant care. The app also includes a marketplace, community features, and a user-friendly interface.

### Problem and Solution Analysis
The app addresses the need for intelligent support in nurturing home plants, given the limited data available for predicting plant health and the significant crop yield lost to pests and diseases worldwide. The solution involves using machine learning to collect, consolidate, and analyze plant data, and provide dynamic recommendations and advice for plant care.

### Functionality
The app's functionality includes:
- Classification and recognition of plants using machine learning models
- Identification of diseased or unhealthy parts of the plant through segmentation
- Recommendations and advice for plant care based on images of the plant
- Marketplace connecting users to sellers of fertilizers, nurseries, etc.
- Community map and event feed for sharing progress and staying motivated

### Design and Build Methodologies
The app is built using Swift and Xcode, and the development process involved experimentation, product genesis, and focused development. The machine learning models used in the app are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and were trained using datasets such as the PlantVillage Dataset.

### App Development
The app's development process involved building a user-friendly interface, onboarding, and integrating the machine learning models into the app. The app's compatibility for the iOS ecosystem and the motivation behind choosing iOS for development are also discussed.
